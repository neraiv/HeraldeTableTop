# HeraldeTableTop Game ðŸŽ²  
A **multiplayer role-playing game (RPG)** where you create and join exciting adventures!

## How Does It Work? ðŸ¤”  

1. **Start Your Server**  
    Run the following command to start your server:  
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```

2. **Register Your Game**  
    Visit the [HeraldeTableTop Website](https://heraldednd.wuaze.com/?i=1) to register your game.
    * This will create a `Game ID` tied to your IP address.  
    * Players can join your game using this `Game ID`.

3. **Data Exchange**  
    The website acts as a **secure middleman** (like a VPN) to exchange data over HTTPS.

## Critical Notes âœ¨  
**This is the first project I am doing in JavaScript/Html/Css also Flask.**
